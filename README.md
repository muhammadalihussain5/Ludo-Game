## How to Play

### Setup

   - Select number of dice (1 or 2)
   - If using 2 dice, choose usage mode:

     - **Both**: Make two separate moves
   - Select color theme
   - Enable/disable custom rules

2. **Start Game**: Tap "Start Game" to begin

### Gameplay
1. **Roll Dice**: Tap the dice or "Roll Dice" button
2. **Move Tokens**: 
   - If "Show available moves" is enabled: Available moves are highlighted
   - If disabled: Tap any token to attempt a move (manual mode)
   - For 2-dice choice mode, select which die value to use first
3. **Mandatory Capture**: When capture is possible and rule is enabled:
   - You MUST capture the opponent's piece
   - Failing to capture returns your piece to start
4. **Safe Spot Blocking**: When enabled:
   - If you occupy another player's safe spot, they can't land there

- **Extra Turns**: Rolling a 6 or capturing gives another turn
